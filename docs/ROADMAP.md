# Long-term dev notes

Decisions and plans that span releases. Short entries; details live in the code, the
release notes and the Shammy plan.

## v1.0: rename to Shammy

Done in v1.0, not in a prerelease.

| Today | From v1.0 |
|---|---|
| RAG Workbench (desktop app) | **Shammy Workbench** |
| `.shammy` vector store and file format | **ShammyDB** |
| `rag` and `shammy` command lines | **Shammy CLI** (one `shammy` command) |
| `shammy-rag` shared retrieval library (Python, C, C#) | **Shammy Engine** |

Things the rename touches: app name, installer and bundle ids, the data folder, the CLI entry
points (keep `rag` as an alias for a release), Python package names, the `.ragworkspace`
marker and `.ragpack` extension (read the old names forever), docs, and the GitHub repository.

## 0.4.1 / 0.4.2

- Page headers and footers: keep the document number, revision and title once per document as
  metadata (shown in citations); detect them by position and repetition over runs of pages,
  including odd/even and per-section variants; remove them from scanned pages too.
- Word text boxes (DrawingML and VML), without reading AlternateContent twice.
- Forms on scanned pages: label/value pairs and checkbox states from OCR.

## To measure on real machines (0.4.0)

- Picture model (Qwen3-VL 4B and 2B): seconds per picture and memory on GPU and on CPU, next to
  the embedding model; whether the GPU-to-CPU fallback triggers; description quality on photos
  and screenshots from work instructions.
- Reranker (Qwen3-Reranker 0.6B, and any 4B/8B file tried): added search time, and whether the
  order is better on real questions.
- Scanned pages with tables: time per page with the second reads, and how many cells they fix.
- Shammy at scale: `shammy bench` on a large real knowledge base to set the stage 1 default, and
  the thread speed-up on 6-8 cores.
- Windows: install, first-run downloads, both helper models starting, a build and search on a
  Shammy knowledge base while another window searches it, `rag convert` and compaction.
- Retrieval server: `ShammyRetriever` in the .NET MCP server against `ragpack/1` and `ragpack/2`.
